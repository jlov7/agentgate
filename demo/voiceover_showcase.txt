AgentGate sits between agents and tools, enforcing policy in real time.
We allow a safe read, deny an unknown tool, and require approval for a write.
With an approval token, the write succeeds.
We trigger the kill switch, block further access, and export a full evidence pack with HTML, PDF, and metrics.
