AgentGate is a containment-first security gateway for AI tools.
Every call is evaluated in real time.
We allow a safe read, deny an unknown tool, and require approval for writes.
With an approval token, the write succeeds.
We activate the kill switch, block further access, and export an evidence pack with HTML, PDF, and metrics.
