AgentGate is a reference implementation created for research and demonstration purposes.

This is independent technical research developed by PwC practitioners. The concepts and implementation represent practitioner perspectives, not official firm positions. PwC has not independently verified the code for production use.

It is **not** production-ready, is **not** hardened, and does **not** claim compliance with any standard (e.g., FedRAMP, SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI).

Use at your own risk. If you adapt this code for real environments, perform a full security review.
