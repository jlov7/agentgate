# Component Library

## Core Building Blocks

### Cards

Use `ag-card` for compact summary blocks with one clear primary action.

### Steppers

Use `ag-workflow-stepper` with `data-ag-workflow` for multi-stage operational journeys.

### Tables

Use `ag-workflow-table` for rollout stage comparisons and gate outcomes.

### Alerts and Risk Surfaces

Use `ag-risk` with severity modifiers:

- `ag-risk--info`
- `ag-risk--warn`
- `ag-risk--high`
- `ag-risk--critical`

Always pair color with explicit text labels for risk severity.

### Loading States

Use `ag-skeleton` rows for asynchronous loads and pair with status text when loads exceed one second.

### Timelines

Use `ag-lab-timeline` or `ag-workflow-timeline` for event ordering with clear timestamps and decisions.
