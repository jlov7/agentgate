# UX Maintenance Model

## Cadence

1. Weekly UX triage: review friction, support, and analytics.
2. Bi-weekly design-system sync: tokens/components/pattern drift review.
3. Monthly persona journey audit and checklist refresh.

## Ownership

1. Product Design owns IA, journeys, and content quality.
2. Frontend Engineering owns implementation quality and regressions.
3. Security/Platform owners approve safety-critical UX changes.

## Definition of Healthy UX

1. Journey pages remain current with backend behavior.
2. Primary onboarding path stays under 10 minutes to first value.
3. Release gates include UX verification evidence.
