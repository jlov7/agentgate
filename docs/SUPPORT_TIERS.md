# Support Tiers

Support tiers define response expectations and escalation paths.

## Tier Matrix

| Tier | Coverage | Channels | Sev-1 Response | Sev-2 Response |
|------|----------|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Community | Best effort | GitHub issues | No SLA | No SLA |
| Professional | Business hours | Email + ticketing | 1 hour | 4 hours |
| Enterprise | 24/7 | Dedicated channel + on-call bridge | 15 minutes | 1 hour |

## Escalation Policy

1. Incident triage starts in standard support channel.
2. Sev-1 or security-impacting incidents escalate immediately to on-call.
3. Customer-facing status updates are posted on the status page until resolution.

## Incident Closure Output

Every Sev-1/Sev-2 incident should produce:

- signed incident report
- rollback/recovery summary
- preventive action list and target date
