# Workspaces

<div data-ag-context></div>

AgentGate workspaces are role-oriented views over the same backend control system.

## Quick Start Summary

Select a persona workspace, switch terminology mode, save tenant-specific views, and use adaptive defaults to reduce setup friction.

## Workspace Capabilities

1. Executive workspace with KPI narrative tiles and business language.
2. Security workspace for policy drift, incident risk, and quarantine queue.
3. Engineering workspace for API health, integration status, and rollout controls.
4. Compliance workspace for evidence exports and control mapping shortcuts.
5. Ops workspace for active alerts, runbooks, and rollback quick actions.

## Design Rule

Each workspace should answer three questions immediately:

1. What is the current state?
2. What changed recently?
3. What should I do next?
