# UX Review Rubric

Score each proposed UX change from 1-5 per dimension.

1. Clarity: Is the next action obvious?
2. Friction: Does this reduce steps or uncertainty?
3. Safety: Does this preserve containment and guardrail intent?
4. Trust: Are status, risk, and evidence signals understandable?
5. Accessibility: Is the change keyboard and screen-reader friendly?
6. Consistency: Does it match shared patterns/tokens/components?

## Approval Rule

A change should not ship if any dimension scores below 3 without explicit mitigation.
