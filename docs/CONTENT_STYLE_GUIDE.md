# Content Style Guide

## Voice

1. Clear, direct, and operational.
2. Outcome-first before implementation detail.
3. Avoid unexplained jargon in primary journey pages.

## CTA Rules

1. Start CTAs with verbs (`Run`, `Review`, `Export`, `Validate`).
2. Tie each CTA to one clear outcome.
3. Limit primary CTA count per section to avoid choice overload.

## Error and Empty-State Pattern

Each message should include:

1. What happened.
2. Why it matters.
3. What to do next.
4. Link to the most relevant guide.

## Reading-Level Tiers

1. Executive/POC pages: minimal technical vocabulary.
2. Engineering pages: concise implementation detail.
3. Compliance pages: control/evidence terminology with explicit definitions.
